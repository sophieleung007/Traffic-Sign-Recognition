# Traffic-Sign-Recognition

This repository contains an efficient traffic sign recognition project using YOLOv2 and YOLOv8, optimized for low-power devices.

## Features
- Implements YOLOv8 training with Ultralytics for traffic sign detection.
- Includes YOLOv2 setup with Darknet for comparison.
- Measures inference time and FPS on test images.
- Provides model metrics and visualization.

## Usage
- Run the script locally with Python and required dependencies (e.g., `ultralytics`, `opencv-python`, `darknet`).
- Update paths (e.g., `weights_path`, `image_dir`) as needed.
